## Historical projects

For reference only; I don't recommend actually running any of these.

### [Hackpad](../../Hackpad) (2012-2014)

An iOS app I wrote while contracting for Hackpad. Hackpad was a
real-time collaborative wiki, and served as the basis for Dropbox
Paper. Commit history was not provided when Dropbox released the code.

### [VMware View Open Client](../../VMware-view-open-client) (2008-2011)

A Linux and Mac client for VMware Horizon (formerly View), providing
remote access to virtual Windows desktops. Tarballs were released on
Google Code, but commit history was not available.

### [Gom](../../gom) (2008)

Side project I worked on for a while attempting to bring a native Gtk
interface to AJAX web apps.

### [Bug Buddy](../../bug-buddy) (1999-2002)

My first real open source app, bug-buddy allowed Linux users to submit
higher-quality bug reports. Looking back, no mechanisms to ensure user
privacy were included. It was a simpler time.
